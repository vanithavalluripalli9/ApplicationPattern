# Implementing Node.js application in VSCode

Visual Studio Code includes built-in JavaScript IntelliSense, formatting, code navigation, refactorings, and many other advanced language features. Most of these features just work out of the box, while some may require basic configuration to get the best experience. Some of the useful features provided by VSCode to implement Node.js applications are as below, 

### JavaScript Language Support
By using the .js file extension, VS Code interprets this file as JavaScript and will evaluate the contents with the JavaScript language service. 

### IntelliSense
IntelliSense shows you intelligent code completion, hover information, and signature information so that you can write code more quickly and correctly.VS Code provides IntelliSense within your JavaScript projects; for many npm libraries such as express.
See [Working with JavaScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) for information about VS Code's JavaScript IntelliSense

### Snippets
VS Code includes basic JavaScript [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) that are suggested as you type.

### Type checking
You can leverage some of TypeScript's advanced type checking and error reporting functionality in regular JavaScript files too. This is a great way to catch common programming mistakes. These type checks also enable some exciting Quick Fixes for JavaScript, including Add missing import and Add missing property.

### JSDoc support
VS Code understands many standard JSDoc annotations, and uses these annotations to provide rich IntelliSense.

### Auto imports
Automatic imports speed up coding by suggesting available variables throughout your project and its dependencies. When you select one of these suggestions, VS Code automatically adds an import for it to the top of the file.

### Code navigation
Code navigation lets you quickly navigate JavaScript projects. By using this functionality , one can go to definition , reference and type definition.

### Unused variables and unreachable code
Unused JavaScript code, such the else block of an if statement that is always true or an unreferenced import, is faded out in the editor.
This provides developer a clear view to remove unused code.
