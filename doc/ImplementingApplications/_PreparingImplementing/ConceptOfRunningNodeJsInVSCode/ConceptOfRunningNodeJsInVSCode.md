# Running Node.js application in VSCode

Visual Studio Code includes a fully-featured integrated terminal that conveniently starts at the root of your workspace.
The integrated terminal can use various shells installed on your machine, with the defaults being:
* PowerShell on Windows
* bash on macOS and Linux

Node.js applications can be run directly from the integrated terminal and avoid switching out of VS Code while running command-line tools.
Multiple terminals can be launched which provides option to run multiple Node.js application from a single VSCode window
